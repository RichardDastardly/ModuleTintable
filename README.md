This is the first thing I've ever done in C#, the first thing I've ever coded in Unity, and the first bit of windows coding 
since I last used Delphi ( and the first bit of code in anything for a couple of years, it's surprising how easy you forget ).

So, it's probably going to be awful.

Current issues:

- Loading saved craft into the editor is all sorts of wonky - changing part colours can update other parts visually, only they're not *really* updated.
- Light direction appears to be from straight up no matter where the sun is - not sure if that's me or KSP.
- Probably others, not like I've done much exhaustive testing yet.
