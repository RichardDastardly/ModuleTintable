This is the first thing I've ever done in C#, the first thing I've ever coded in Unity, and the first bit of windows coding 
since I last used Delphi ( and the first bit of code in anything for a couple of years, it's surprising how easy you forget ).

So, it's probably going to be awful.

Current issues:

- Probably a heap of stuff I haven't found.
- Shader needs some work.
