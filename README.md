This is the first thing I've ever done in C#, the first thing I've ever coded in Unity, and the first bit of windows coding 
since I last used Delphi ( and the first bit of code in anything for a couple of years, it's surprising how easy you forget ).

So, it's probably going to be awful.

Current issues:

- No idea if multiple colour entries work
- Too many bodges right now, refactoring will come after I manage to work out what's going on yet again.
